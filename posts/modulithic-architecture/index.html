				<p>The past decade saw everyone from startups to tech titans jumping onto the microservices bandwagon, hoping to untangle themselves from their unmaintainable monoliths. The trend can be traced back to <a href="https://nordicapis.com/the-bezos-api-mandate-amazons-manifesto-for-externalization/">Jeff Bezos&rsquo; API memo at Amazon</a>, followed by a wave of innovation by Netflix engineering. As tech companies grew, centralized governance became impractical. They transitioned from viewing their organization as a system to an ecosystem, allowing for greater autonomy and concentrated decision-making within teams, and it paid off.</p>
<p>But then something strange happened. Microservices spread everywhere, but the original intention of aligning architecture with organizational design got lost in the folklore. It became an adopted practice simply because everyone else was doing it, and let&rsquo;s face it, we all felt the urge to do something about the &ldquo;monolith in the room&rdquo;. The thing is though, the smaller the product the more the &ldquo;micro&rdquo; part really stings, at least how I&rsquo;ve seen it in the wild where the microservices to team ratio can be 5 or more. Security patches become a constant game of whack-a-mole. Re-imagining the service boundaries dreamed up long ago becomes a year-long coordinated effort. The effort of integrating new build tools or processes is multiplied by the number of services. Developers are left drowning in maintenance tasks.</p>
<p>But what if monolith and microservices are two ends of a spectrum? We could find a sweet spot that gives us the encapsulation and isolation while keeping the system malleable to the demands of an ever-changing reality. We could hang on to team independence and developer autonomy, but ensure enough consistency in the technology stack that developers can work across many components of the system. We can deploy parts of the system in isolation without the nightmare of breaking our system into a huge jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>This is the sweet spot that modulithic architectures hit. With better support for modularity and encapsulation in our programming tools we can take the &ldquo;micro&rdquo; out of microservices. We can scope services to be team-sized, so that a team is responsible for maintaining one or two services at most. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re just creating a more modular monolith either. A modulithic service can be one of many services, but you consciously evaluate where those boundaries are weighed up against the maintenance burden it places on future development.</p>
<p>To achieve this modularity two practices are essential:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State of the art testing</strong> Testcontainers, snapshot testing, shared fixtures, better mocking tools. The Node.js ecosystem is leaps ahead of Java here, but that <a href="https://github.com/origin-energy/java-snapshot-testing">gap is closing</a>. Fast, repeatable, reliable tests that are easy to read and write gives developers the confidence to make changes in a busy repo. The shift away from testing microscopic pieces of code (unless justified by complexity) towards testing the behavior of your API or application is essential too. This is no longer the responsibility of fragile Selenium suites.</li>
<li><strong>Architecture tests</strong> The first developers on a project lay out a folder structure with an architecture in mind, but the structure lives only in their minds and so tends to disintegrate over time as others fail to grasp the vision, a phenomenon called &ldquo;architecture degradation&rdquo;. Tools like ArchUnit allow us to codify and enforce these constraints. My side project Maven enforcer plugin <a href="https://github.com/bcoughlan/base-package-enforcer-rule">base-package-enforcer-rule</a> <a href="https://github.com/bcoughlan/base-package-enforcer-rule/blob/main/ArchUnitExampleTest.java">allows you to use ArchUnit</a> to enforce architecture constraints based on your module structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The folder structure of a modulithic project resembles the service structure of a microservices ecosystem:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># Top-level module with a main() method, depends on services/*</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">app/
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># Domain-specific parts of the application</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># These would be individual services in a microservices architecture.</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">services/
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  orders/
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  products/
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  billing/
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># Code shared between services/* modules</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">libs/
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  audit/
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  utils/
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  etc...</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What about service-to-service communication? Services that talk across a network have an accessible API and hidden internals. We can achieve the same thing with a common module that exposes the interface for other services.</p>
<p><img src="/images/modulith-deps.png" alt="Modulith dependencies"></p>
<p>The services can&rsquo;t accidentally depend on another&rsquo;s internals, yet refactoring is only a few keystrokes away.</p>
<p>When I first heard the term &ldquo;modulith&rdquo;, I thought it was just a return monolith for embarrassed proponents of microservices who wanted to save face. Now that I&rsquo;ve put it in practice I see it as a light in a dark-age of copy-paste software architecture.</p>
